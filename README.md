## How to Play
1. The program generates a random number within a range (e.g., 1 to 100).
2. The player is prompted to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the program provides feedback:
   - "Too high" if the guess is higher than the target number.
   - "Too low" if the guess is lower than the target number.
   - "Correct!" when the player guesses the number.
4. The game tracks and displays the number of attempts.
5. After the game ends, the player has the option to restart or exit.
